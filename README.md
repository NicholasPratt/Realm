An adventure game for Agon Light

REALM REQUIRES BBCBASIC24 (please download from Dean Belfield's GITHUB)

This game is currently a BETA version as it is not completed.
I have released this version looking for feedback and encouragment. 

Many hours have gone into this and there's still many hours to go.

The level design is completely modular a relies on text files for the level content.
